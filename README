Description
-----------
Tych Panel is an extension to Adobe Photoshop that automates diptychs and
triptychs creation. It supports an arbitrary number of layouts using the
compositing feature. Together with the panel, Tych Panel is more powerful than
any other similiar script I've come across. 

Tych Panel is released as open source and can be used, modified and
redistributed in any way possible.


Installation
------------

1. Copy __scripts/Tych__ Panel to __<your photoshop directory>/Presets/Scripts__.
2. Open __Tych Panel.gpc__ in Adobe Configurator and export it to __<your photoshop
directory>/Plug-ins/Panels__.
3. Enable the panel via __Window/Extensions/Tych Panel__ in Photoshop.
