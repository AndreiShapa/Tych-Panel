Description
-----------
Tych Panel is an extension to Adobe Photoshop that automates diptychs and
triptychs creation. It supports an arbitrary number of layouts using the
compositing feature. Together with the panel, Tych Panel is more powerful than
any other similiar script I've come across. 

Tych Panel is released as open source and can be used, modified and
redistributed in any way possible.

What's new in Tych Panel 2.0?
-----------------------------
Features:
* Reorder images with thumbnails.
* Added option to use selected images in Adobe Bridge as input.
* Save as PSD.

Bug fixes:
* Compositing images with the same name in different iterations now work as expected.

On the list:
* Support image formats with layers.
* Background color option.
* Convert images to smart objects.
* Ability to rearrange layers over and over again with the layout buttons.
* Image spacing in percent.
* Target height option.
* Outer border width and color options.
* Use unlinked layer masks instead of cropping images.
* Apply an arbitrary number of actions.
